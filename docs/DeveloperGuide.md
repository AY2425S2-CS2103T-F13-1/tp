## Design

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The architecture follows a component-based design with clear separation of concerns. Each component is designed to be modular and maintainable.

#### Core Components

- **Logic**: Processes commands and business logic
- **Model**: Manages data and state
- **Storage**: Handles data persistence
- **UI**: Handles user interaction and display
- **Common Classes**: Shared utilities and helpers

#### Component Interactions

The sequence diagram below shows how components interact when processing a `delete 1` command:

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each component:

- Defines its API in an `interface` with the same name as the component
- Implements functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class
- Interacts with other components through their interfaces rather than concrete classes

[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Logic Component

The Logic component handles command processing and business rules.

#### Command Flow

1. User enters command through UI
2. `LogicManager` receives command
3. `AddressBookParser` parses command
4. Appropriate command class executes
5. Results returned through component chain

#### Key Classes

The Logic component uses a command pattern for handling different operations. Here's how it works:

1. **Command Classes**:

   - `Command`: Abstract base class for all commands
   - Specific implementations like:
     - `AddCommand`: Adds a new patient
     - `DeleteCommand`: Removes a patient
     - `EditCommand`: Modifies patient details
     - `NoteCommand`: Adds/manages patient notes
     - `ListCommand`: Shows all patients

2. **Parser Classes**:
   <img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

   - `Parser`: Interface that all command parsers implement
   - Specific implementations like:
     - `AddCommandParser`: Parses add command arguments
     - `DeleteCommandParser`: Parses delete command index
     - `NoteCommandParser`: Parses note command arguments

The term "XYZ" in the documentation represents a placeholder for specific command names. For example:

- `XYZCommand` could be `AddCommand`, `DeleteCommand`, etc.
- `XYZCommandParser` could be `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, etc.

## Model Component

#### Model Structure

The Model component manages application data and state.

#### Key Features

- Stores address book data
- Maintains filtered lists
- Manages user preferences
- Handles patient notes
- Implements undo/redo

#### Data Structures

- `UniquePatientList`: Core patient storage
- `TreeSet<Note>`: Ordered note storage
- `VersionedAddressBook`: Undo/redo support

#### Component API

```java
public interface Model {
    void addPatient(Patient patient);
    void deletePerson(Patient target);
    void updateFilteredPatientList(Predicate<Patient> predicate);
    void commitAddressBook();
}
```

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450"/>

The Model component maintains:

- Patient data in `UniquePatientList`
- User preferences in `UserPrefs`
- Filtered patient views
- Note management system

[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Storage Component

The Storage component handles data persistence.

#### Features

- JSON-based storage
- Automatic saving
- Data validation
- Backup support

#### Key Classes

- `Storage`: Main component interface
- `JsonAddressBookStorage`: Address book storage
- `JsonUserPrefsStorage`: User preferences storage
- `JsonAdaptedPatient`: JSON serialization

#### Component API

```java
public interface Storage {
    Path getAddressBookFilePath();
    Optional<ReadOnlyAddressBook> readAddressBook();
    void saveAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook addressBook);
}
```

#### Storage Integration

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The Storage component provides JSON-based persistence with:

- `JsonAddressBookStorage`: Handles patient data
- `JsonUserPrefsStorage`: Manages user preferences
- `JsonAdaptedPatient`: Converts between JSON and Patient objects

---

## UI Component

The UI component manages all user-facing elements of the application.

#### Key Classes

- `MainWindow`: The root UI container
- `CommandBox`: Handles command input
- `ResultDisplay`: Shows command results
- `PatientListPanel`: Displays patient list
- `NotesDisplayPanel`: Shows patient notes
- `StatusBarFooter`: Displays status information

#### Implementation

The UI:

- Uses JavaFX framework
- Defines layouts in `.fxml` files under `src/main/resources/view`
- Follows MVVM pattern for data binding
- Implements responsive design principles
- Uses custom styling defined in `styles.css`

#### Component API

```java
public interface Ui {
    /** Starts the UI (and the App). */
    void start(Stage primaryStage);

    /** Returns the primary stage. */
    Stage getPrimaryStage();
}
```

## Common Classes

Classes used across multiple components:

- `LogsCenter`: Centralized logging
- `Config`: Application configuration
- `StringUtil`: String manipulation utilities
- `CollectionUtil`: Collection helpers

## Implementation

This section describes the implementation details of key features in NeuroSync.

### Patient Management

The patient management system is the core functionality of NeuroSync.

#### Features

- Adding new patients
- Editing patient information
- Deleting patients
- Viewing patient details
- Search and filter capabilities

#### Implementation Details

```java
public class Patient {
    private final Name name;
    private final Phone phone;
    private final Address address;
    private final Set<Tag> tags;
    private final TreeSet<Note> notes;
    // ...
}
```

The `Patient` class is immutable, ensuring thread safety and preventing accidental modifications.

#### Notable Design Considerations

**Aspect: Patient Data Storage**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Store all patient data in memory
  - Pros: Fast access and modifications
  - Cons: Limited by available memory
- **Alternative 2**: Store patient data in database
  - Pros: Can handle large datasets
  - Cons: More complex setup, slower access

---

### Notes Feature

The notes system allows psychiatrists to maintain detailed records of patient sessions.

#### Command Flow: Add Note

<img src="images/AddNoteSequenceDiagram.png" width="800"/>

1. User enters: `note 1 nt/Session 1 nc/Patient anxious`
2. `LogicManager` receives command
3. `AddressBookParser` creates `NoteCommandParser`
4. Parser validates and creates `NoteCommand`
5. Command executes and updates model

#### Command Flow: View Notes

<img src="images/ViewNoteSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

1. User enters `viewnote 1` command
2. Command parsed and validated
3. Patient retrieved from model
4. Notes fetched and sorted
5. Results displayed to user

#### Implementation Details

```java
public class Note implements Comparable<Note> {
    private final String title;
    private final String content;
    private final LocalDateTime createdAt;

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Note other) {
        return createdAt.compareTo(other.createdAt);
    }
}
```

Notes are automatically sorted by creation date using a `TreeSet`.

#### Notable Design Considerations

**Aspect: Note Storage Structure**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Store notes within Patient object
  - Pros: Direct access, simpler implementation
  - Cons: Larger memory footprint
- **Alternative 2**: Store notes separately with references
  - Pros: Memory efficient
  - Cons: More complex querying

### Undo/Redo Feature

The undo/redo mechanism allows users to reverse or reapply changes. This feature is implemented using command pattern and state management.

#### State Management Implementation

The undo/redo feature uses state management to track changes in the address book. Below are the different states and transitions:

##### Initial State

<img src="images/UndoRedoState0.png" width="300"/>

- When the app launches, it starts with a single address book state
- Current state pointer points to the initial state

##### After `delete 5` Command

<img src="images/UndoRedoState1.png" width="300"/>

- A new `AddressBook` state is created
- Current state pointer is moved to the new state
- Previous state is preserved for potential undo

##### After `add n/David` Command

<img src="images/UndoRedoState2.png" width="300"/>

- Another new `AddressBook` state is created
- Current state pointer moves to this new state
- All previous states are preserved in sequence

##### After `undo` Command

<img src="images/UndoRedoState3.png" width="300"/>

- Current state pointer moves back to previous state
- State is restored to before `add n/David` was executed
- Most recent state is preserved for potential redo

##### After `list` Command

<img src="images/UndoRedoState4.png" width="300"/>

- List command does not modify address book state
- Current state pointer remains unchanged
- No new state is created

##### After `clear` Command

<img src="images/UndoRedoState5.png" width="300"/>

- New state is created with empty address book
- Current state pointer moves to new state
- All previous states are preserved for potential undo

#### Implementation Details

The feature is implemented using the `VersionedAddressBook` class:

```java
public class VersionedAddressBook extends AddressBook {
    private List<ReadOnlyAddressBook> addressBookStateList;
    private int currentStatePointer;

    public void commit() {
        // Save current state
    }

    public void undo() {
        // Restore previous state
    }

    public void redo() {
        // Restore next state
    }
}
```

#### Command Processing Flow

The sequence diagrams below illustrate how undo/redo commands are processed:

##### Logic Component Handling

<img src="images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png" width="600"/>

- Shows how the Logic component processes the undo command
- Demonstrates interaction between command classes and model

##### Model Component Handling

<img src="images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png" width="400"/>

- Shows how the Model component handles state changes
- Illustrates state pointer management during undo operations

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: State Storage Method**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Store full states
  - Pros: Simple implementation, reliable
  - Cons: Higher memory usage
- **Alternative 2**: Store command history
  - Pros: Memory efficient
  - Cons: Complex implementation, potential bugs

## Testing

To run all tests, use:

```
./gradlew test
```

To write new tests:

1. Create a new test class in the `src/test/java` directory
2. Annotate test methods with `@Test`
3. Follow the naming convention: `{MethodName}_{TestScenario}_expectedBehavior`
   Example: `delete_validIndex_success()`

To check test coverage:

```
./gradlew jacocoTestReport
```

The report will be generated in `build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`

To run specific test classes:

```
./gradlew test --tests "seedu.address.logic.commands.AddCommandTest"
```

[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### User Stories

As a psychiatrist, I can view all the patients' information including name, phone number,address so that it is easier for me to have a quick view of all the patients I have.

As a psychiatrist, I can easily add new patients to the app, so that I can maintain an organized record of my patients.

As a psychiatrist having many patients, I can easily search for a patient in the list by inputting any 
user information (name, phone, address), so that I can get their details or view their meeting notes.

As a psychiatrist in a consultation session with a patient, I can take note of information
about this session, so that I can refer to it during the patient's next visit.

As a psychiatrist preparing for my next consultation session, I can view all the notes
of the upcoming patient, so that I can recall any important information about this patient.

### Appendix: Effort

Difficulty level: Moderate, twice as hard as Individual Project

Challenges faced:
- Reading through and understanding AB3 codes, many layers of abstraction, many unfamiliar models, classes, methods
- Implementing new commands, was difficult finding where to add various chunks of code, many classes from all over the application had to be changed, tests had to be added
- Git workflows, merge conflicts, so many additional steps to make sure things go smoothly

Effort required: High

Achievements of the project:
- Very familiar with git workflows now, comfortable working on team projects iteratively
- Learnt and appreciated the abstractions of code in AB3, even though it looks like a lot of redundant work for such a simple application, it made sure that everything ran smoothly and greatly reduced the potential number of bugs
- Learnt about proper documentation and standard conventions in code and git

### Planned Enhancements

- Support for various languages including right-justified languages
- Adding of NRIC numbers and masking it

### Appendix: Requirements

System Requirements:
- Java: Version 17
- Compatibility: Windows, macOS, Linux

#### Non-Functional Requirements

- The application should load the main interface within 10 seconds on standard hardware.
- Searching for a patient should return results in under 1 second for up
to 10,000 contacts.
- The response to any use action should become visible within 5 seconds.
- The user interface should be intuitive enough for users who are not IT-savvy.
