## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: How do I transfer my data to another computer?**  
**A:** Install NeuroSync on the other computer and run it once. Then, replace the data file created (usually in the same directory or under `/data`) with your original data file from your previous device.

**Q2: Where is the data stored?**  
**A:** Your patient and note data is saved in a file called `addressbook.json` located in the `/data` folder in the same directory where you launch `NeuroSync.jar`.

**Q3: I deleted a note/patient by accident. Can I undo it?**  
**A:** Currently, NeuroSync does not support an undo feature. We recommend regularly backing up your data file if you need to keep a revision history.

**Q4: What happens when I run `clear`?**  
**A:** The `clear` command removes all stored patient and note data. This action is irreversible, so use it with caution.
